# Word Embeddings

This folder must contain two files for the tool to run:

* word2vec_dsl_sentences_reddit_sentences_300_cbow_negative.kv
* word2vec_dsl_sentences_reddit_sentences_300_cbow_negative.kv.vectors.npy

They can be obtained [here](https://figshare.com/articles/Danish_DSL_and_Reddit_word2vec_word_embeddings/8099927).

This folder contains the word2vec word embeddings used for creation of feature vectors.
The word embeddings have been trained on both sentence data from [dsl](https://dsl.dk/) and on reddit data from the danish stance dataset.

The sentence data is not publicy available, but can possibly be obtained by contacting dsl.
